/**
 * Estimates per-word start times and durations by distributing a known total

 * Piper doesn't emit word-level timestamps, so this is a proportional
 * approximation rather than a true alignment — good enough to drive
 * TalkingHead.js's built-in `lipsync-en` module, which derives visemes from
 * `words`/`wtimes`/`wdurations` alone (see talkingface/build-plan.md).
